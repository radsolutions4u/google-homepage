My name is Rehana. This is my google-homepage project. I am a baby to coding, command lines, and everything else that I have learned. However, I love to learn. I am a mother to four and a wife to a terrific guy. I am excited to dedicate time to learn to develop. After doing this project, I will have learned so many tools like using a text editor right now. Creating files on my local drive and then pushing them to a remote storage like GitHub. I have learned so much in the last week.
